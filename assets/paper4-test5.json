PASSAGE Man's dependence on plants is indispensable. It is this dependence for food, shelter and clothing that has led him to explore all possible ways to preserve plants from being lost to the ravages of natural or man-made calamities. Accordingly, man has used various methods to overcome these calamities. While doing so, scientists hit-upon a technique whereby plants cannot be restored from being lost, but can be developed into a complete plant from a small plant part. This technique, called tissue culture, subsequently proved to be a boon for mankind.Basically, tissue culture is a technique by which small pieces of different parts of a plant body are grown on a nutritional media, under completely sterile conditions. These explants divide and gradually develop either into an unorganized mass of cells called callus or after a few cell divisions, differentiate to form full-fledge plants. This concept of tissue culture dates back to 1878. Scientists like Harbertlandt in 1902, postulated that cultivation of artificial embryos can be possible 'depending on the nutritional media. \n\nAfter a few cell divisions, the explants form into","correctChoiceId":"C1","answerExplanation":"","choices":[{"choiceId":"C1","value":"full-fledged plants"},{"choiceId":"C2","value":"parts of a plant"},{"choiceId":"C3","value":"callus"},{"choiceId":"C4","value":"weak plants"}]},{"subTopicId":27,"questionId":"49649","label":"Directions (Q 121-125): Read the passage given below carefully and choose the best answer to each question out of the four given alternatives.
